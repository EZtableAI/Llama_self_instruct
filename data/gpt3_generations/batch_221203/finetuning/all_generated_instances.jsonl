{"instruction": "You have to write an article about a new fashion trend in 2015.", "input": "", "output": "Fashion is a popular topic in the media, and it seems like every year there\u2019s a new trend that everyone has to follow. In 2015, one of the most popular trends was wearing clothes with words on them. This trend started when people began printing their own t-shirts at home using their inkjet printers. The first shirts were simple designs with just a few words, but as time went on, more and more people started making shirts with longer phrases or even entire sentences. Some people even made shirts with quotes from famous books or movies.\nThe popularity of this trend can be attributed to its low cost. It only costs about $10 to print a shirt at home, which is much cheaper than buying a shirt from a store. Also, since you can make your own design, you don\u2019t have to worry about not being able to find a shirt that fits your style.\nThis trend also allows people to express themselves in a unique way. Since they are printed at home, these shirts are often very personal. People use them to show off their interests, such as their favorite sports team or hobby. They can also be used to tell others about what you believe in, such as an environmental cause or political party.\nSince this trend is so popular, many companies have started selling pre-printed shirts. These shirts are usually sold in stores, and they come in a variety of styles and colors. However, some people prefer to buy blank shirts and print their own designs."}
